# Jupyter Weekly News

Hello Jovyans! Welcome to the first edition of the Jupyter weekly newsletter,
a weekly recap on what's going in the Jupyter world. We are aware that the current
development of Jupyter and all the repositories, mailing lists, and Gitter channels
are hard to follow, so we will try to make a weekly recap of the important
points.

Feel free [to contribute](https://github.com/Carreau/jupyter-news) during the
week of any links, descriptions of related projects, or important pull requests 
that have been merged or are about to be merged.

Thanks!

# New Jupyter website

Thanks to the work of @cameronoelsen, we now have a brand new
[jupyter.org](https://jupyter.org) website. We are currently doing user studies on
the website in order to improve page flow, visitor happiness, and make information easier to find.

For example we have now removed the word "Docs" and replaced it with "Documentation"
as "Docs" was misinterpreted as "Documents".

As usual the website source-code is on GitHub, and we eagerly await your
feedback of course, and pull-requests!  If your institution is using Jupyter
and you would like you logo on the main page, feel free to tell us and we can add it
to the main page once we get the proper authorization.


# Jupyter Enhancement Proposal Repository

The old way of doing IPEP/JPEP on the wiki was a bit tough and hard to follow.
We are working on making the process easier to follow and more explicit.

JEPs are now located in their own repository.  You can submit a
pull request for big enhancement proposal. You can still open and issue
or submit a pull request for smaller fixes on individual repositories.

Check out the [jupyter/enhancemnet-proposals](https://github.com/jupyter/enhancement-proposals)
repository for more information!

# Governance

For global decision on what direction the project is going, and how we
take decisions you might be aware that we have a steering council. The documents
that describe how this works and who is in the steering council are now also
[on GitHub](https://github.com/jupyter/governance). If you are interested in
legal aspects or how we work, you can head there.

# IBM Contributions

Big Blue has some nice in-progress internal extensions of the notebook
application they are willing to open source and contribute back to the project.

You can see the demo [on youtube](https://youtu.be/SJiezXPhVv8), which
demonstrates search by notebook name and contents, declarative widgets, and
construction of dashboard using the notebook. Each of these feature is also
[described][1] in [three][3] different [blog posts][2] from IBM and the three
principal authors.

# Standardize Interactive Visualizations

Quoting Brian Granger's mail:

> [...]
>
> I had excellent conversations at PyData Settle with Peter Wang
> (Bokeh), Thomas Caswell (Matplotlib), Jake vpd (mpld3), Matt Sundquist
> (Plotly) and Jeff Heer. The idea that I was proposing is that our
> community starts to adopt the vega-lite spec for specifying high level
> visualizations. There is still alot to be worked out, but here is the
> idea:
>
> * Write a user-focused high-level plotting API whose sole goal is to
> emit vega-lite specs.
> * Write code in Matplotlib, Bokeh, Plotly that can consume those
> vega-lite specs and produce a relevant visualizations.
> * Write new, notebook focused UIs (maybe polestar?) that can emit
> those same vega-lite specs without requiring the user to code.
> * Hook it all up in a reactive way using Traitlets.
> [...]

# Phosphor Notebook Rewriting

Phosphor components now use TypeScript 1.6 beta, which should simplify
packaging, and usage of Node modules which are shipped with TypeScript
definition files.

# Managing Multiple Kernels

Min is working on [a2kn](https://github.com/minrk/a2km) to manage kernelspecs.
If you have many environments or find yourself editing kernel.json file by
hand, this might be useful for you.

# Binder Improvements

For those of you that missed the announcement, [binder](http://mybinder.org/) turns
a GitHub repo into a collection of interactive notebooks. It's very similar to
NBViewer, but gives you the ability to execute code. This is currently no way to express
needed dependencies within a Binder-rendered notebook, but work is being done to make 
`pip` and `apt` dependencies easier to express.

# Ask Questions On Mailing List 

I see a lot of questions asked on Gitter, many stay unanswered. Please consider
sending your question to the mailing list, you will have more chances of getting a
response and it will help us minimize the number of times we have to answer the 
same question.

# Jupyter Does Not Have Profiles

There has been some confusion over whether or not IPython 4.0 has profiles,
IPython 4.0 does have profiles but Jupyter does not have a `--profile` flag
for the various sub applications. The way to change the configuration directory
is to use an environment variable. If anyone is interested in clarifying issues like
this by creating a 3.x to 4.x migration document, please feel free to do so!
