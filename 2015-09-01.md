# Jupyter Weekly new. 

Hello Jovyans, welcome to the first attempt to make a Jupyter weekly recap 
on what's going in on in the Jupyter world. We are aware that the current development
of Jupyter and all the development are hard to follow, so we will try to make a weekly
recap of the important points. 

Feel free to contribute during the week of any link or description of a related project
or important PR that have been merged, or is about to be merged !

Thanks !


# New Jupyter website

Thanks to the work of @cameronOelsen we have a brand new
[jupyter.org](https://jupyter.org) website. We are doing user studies on it, to
try to improve the page flow of visitors and make things easier to find. 


We area waiting for your feedback of course, and pull-request if you like to
dive into html, CSS and JavaScript.  If your institution is using Jupyter and
you like the logo on the main page, feel free to tell us. 


# Ehancement proposal repo

The old way of doing IPEP/JPEP on the wiki was a bit tough and hard to follow. 
Enhancement proposal are now on it's own repository. 

You can just submit a pull request now. 

This is part of our effort to start communicating more.
